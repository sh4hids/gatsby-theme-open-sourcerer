Gatsby is a modern web framework for blazing fast websites.

- **Go Beyond Static Websites.** Get all the benefits of static websites with none of the
  limitations. Gatsby sites are fully functional React apps so you can create high-quality,
  dynamic web apps, from blogs to e-commerce sites to user dashboards.

- **Use a Modern Stack for Every Site.** No matter where the data comes from, Gatsby sites are
  built using React and GraphQL. Build a uniform workflow for you and your team, regardless of
  whether the data is coming from the same backend.

- **Load Data From Anywhere.** Gatsby pulls in data from any data source, whether it’s Markdown
  files, a headless CMS like Contentful or WordPress, or a REST or GraphQL API. Use source plugins
  to load your data, then develop using Gatsby’s uniform GraphQL interface.

- **Performance Is Baked In.** Ace your performance audits by default. Gatsby automates code
  splitting, image optimization, inlining critical styles, lazy-loading, prefetching resources,
  and more to ensure your site is fast — no manual tuning required.

- **Host at Scale for Pennies.** Gatsby sites don’t require servers so you can host your entire
  site on a CDN for a fraction of the cost of a server-rendered site. Many Gatsby sites can be
  hosted entirely free on [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/cloud/) and other similar services.

## 🚀 Get Up and Running in 5 Minutes

You can get a new Gatsby site up and running on your local dev environment in 5 minutes with these four steps:

1. **Install the Gatsby CLI.**

   ```shell
   npm install -g gatsby-cli

   ```

2. **Create a Gatsby site from a Gatsby starter.**

   Get your Gatsby blog set up in a single command:

   ```shell
   # Create a new Gatsby site using the interactive setup wizard
   # Give it this name: My Gatsby site
   gatsby new
   ```

3. **Start the site in `develop` mode.**

   Next, move into your new site’s directory and start it up:

   ```shell
   cd my-gatsby-site/
   gatsby develop
   ```

4. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`. Open the `my-gatsby-site` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes, and the browser will update in real time!

At this point, you’ve got a fully functional Gatsby website. For additional information on how you can customize your Gatsby site, see our [plugins](https://gatsbyjs.com/plugins/) and [the official tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/).
